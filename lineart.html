            <p>Upon finishing my sketch, I finally start drawing lineart. I often go through my brushes to see which one fits the best.
            Upon choosing my brush, I go over the sketch and try to make it presentable. Where there were messy lines now lay clean,
             precise lines. I don't know how to explain it, but I pretty much clean it up and add details. Barely ever do I actually
            draw something vastly different from my sketch, as that would cause much trouble down the line (e.g not fitting the anatomy,
             not well thought out, looking off. If I ever <em>do</em> draw something different from the sketch, I make another sketch
             solely for that).</p>
             
            <p>I use multiple layers, incase something doesn't fit or needs changing, and at the end clean up my lines (because they're
            digging into other lines). For details, I use lighter lines, and for something important (e.g. the hand) I use bolder lines.
            This helps direct the viewer's attention towards what I want them to see, instead of creating a chaos of "where should I look? What is more imporant?".
            There are more ways to do this, like the construction of the piece, however I often forget to do them.</p>-->
