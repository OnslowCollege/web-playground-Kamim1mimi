            <p>Upon finishing my sketch, I finally start drawing lineart. I often go through my brushes to see which one fits the best.
        Sometiems it takes longer than I'd wish. I usually just trace the lines and add more details. Barely ever do I actually
        draw something very different from the sketch. I like to use multiple layers, incase something happened, and clean up my
        lines (which are often too long and need to be cut down). For details, I use light lines, and for something important
        (e.g. an arm holding something) I use bolder lines. This helps keep the viewer's attention towards what I want them to see,
        instead of creating a chaos of "where should I look?". There are more ways to do this, however I often forget to do them.
