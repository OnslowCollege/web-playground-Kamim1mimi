    <h1>How I draw</h1>
    <h2 class="comment">Hello, I am <em>Kami</em>. Drawing ever since I was a child, I often found myself thinking: "What if I could
    just copy someone else? Find out how they do it, and maybe even implore it into my own way of drawing?" You see,
    humans learn how to everything by <em>copying</em>. Speaking? Copying. Moving? Copying. Drawing? You guessed it,
    <em>copying</em>. It's easier to build a house when you have the ground already there. <br>
    Which is why, today, I am going to share <em>my</em> way of drawing, so you can find out how other people
    draw, and maybe even learn a few things yourself.</h2>

    <h1>1st sketch</h1>
    <h2 class="small-margin">In my opinion, a sketch is one of the most important parts when drawing.
    It determines so many things: what is going on, how it will look when finished, what emotions do you want the viewer to feel, and so much more.
    <br>Without a sketch, you have nothing. Unless you drew it a thousand times.</h2>

    <p>Barely ever is my first sketch something more than a scrambled mess. Understandable only to me, it heavily relies 
    on what I already decided on. I use this part of the process on deciding: where are the characters going to be, 
    what are the characters doing and what is in the background. Then, I make lines and boxes that loosely represent it.
    <br> The first sketch isn't meant to be perfect, it's just a place to put all your thoughts down. The next step is 
    when you get detailked.

    <h2>Sometimes I also draw the outline, a silluete, and kidna.. sculpt it? Slowly add details, one bit by
    another, untill I have a sketch. Or I simply draw the silluete and then draw the <strong>more detailed sketch</strong>
    afterwards.</h2>

    <h1>Detailed sketch</h1>
    <p>This is where I add anatomy, clothing, hair, expression, and pretty much anything (that isn't tiny) I'd like to draw when I'm doing the outline.
    While it's more detailed, it's still messy; however it has enough detail for me to start doing the lineart.
    </p>

    <h2><strong>Optional!</strong> <br> if you want your art to have colors, it's best to color the image (messily) while
    still in the sketching phase. I, however, don't do that because I'm lazy or already have a colored character.
    <br> Don't be me.</h2>
