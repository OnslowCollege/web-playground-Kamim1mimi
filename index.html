    <h1>How I draw</h1>
    <h2 class="comment">Hello, I am <em>Kami</em>. Drawing ever since I was a child, I often found myself thinking: "What if I could
    just copy someone else? Find out how they do it, and maybe even implore it into my own way of drawing?" You see,
    humans learn how to everything by <em>copying</em>. Speaking? Copying. Moving? Copying. Drawing? You guessed it,
    <em>copying</em> It's easier to build a house when you have the ground already there. <br>
    Which is why, today, I am going to share <em>my</em> way of drawing, so you can find out how other people
    draw, and maybe even learn a few things yourself.</h2>

    <h1>Sketch</h1>

    <div><img src="kinda.png" alt="idkanymore"> stuff

    <p>Personally, I deem a sketch the most important part of drawing. It determines where everything will go,how it will look,
    and is the perfect time to give emotion and flow to the art. <br>
    Most if not all times, my first sketch is messy and a understandable to only me. A good sketch should show where
    everything is, how it will look, nd give a feeling. If your sketch doesn't have a feeling (unless you're using colours
    for that), it won't have it at all. Sketching is where you let yourself be free and do whatever you want untill
    you settle for one you like.</p>
    <h2>Sometimes I also draw the outline, a silluete, and kidna.. sculpt it? Slowly add details, one bit by
    another, untill I have a sketch. Or I simply draw the silluete and then draw the <strong>more detailed sketch</strong>
    afterwards.</h2>

    <h1>Detailed sketch</h1>

    <p>This is where I add clothing, hair, expression and over all more detailed character.</p>

    <h2><strong>Optional!</strong> <br> if you want your art to have colors, it's best to color the image (messily) while
    still in the sketching phase. I, however, don't do it often because I'm lazy or already have a colored character.
    <br> Don't be me.</h2>

    <p>(Why am I doing this) Children learn to speak by copying their parents. Coders learn to code by copying what
    others did untill they themselves understood and could go on their own path. Writers learn how to write nad make
    their characters realistic by observing and <em>copying</em></p>
