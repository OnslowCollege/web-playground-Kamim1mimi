        </div>
        <p> If can get away with this, I <em>WILLL</em> <br>
        I <em>despise</em> making background. Not only because I haven't learnt how to make them, but also because I
        usually don't plan for them (big mistake, really). So then whatever I do, it. Just. Doesn't. Fit. And it infuriates me.
        However when I DO make backgrounds that aren't just colors, they're either: half detailed, half empty; gradient (many types);
        or <em>somehow</em> actually good looking backgrund (usually when they're planned. Plan your bgs guys, <em>do it</em>.) 
        good looking, actual backgruond. I don't have much to say about how I do them, except <em>good luck</em>.</p>

        <h1>Finishing touches</h1>
            <p>This includes: watermark; slight fixes; additional detail.
            Watermark is for obvious reasons: so other's wont steal it and claim it as theirs. Slight fixes can wary from fixing colours
            to whole proportions being moved around (it actually happened). I almost never added additional details, as background is
            usually my last stop, but it usualy is only text. It's best to wait an hour or a day before doing this step, as it allows
            your brain to look at the art with a new-comer look, instead of "I have watched these pixels for 5 hours straight
            and any mistake I see is gone behind the light", allowing you to spot the inconsistencies and mistakes.

        it was useful to somebody ^^
