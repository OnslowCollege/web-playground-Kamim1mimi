        <p> If can get away with this, I <em>WILL</em>. <br>
        I <em>despise</em> making background. Not only because I haven't learnt how to make them, but also because I
        usually don't plan for them (big mistake, really). So then whatever I do, it. Just. Doesn't. Fit. And it infuriates me.
        However when I DO make backgrounds that aren't just colors, they're either: half detailed, half empty; gradient (many types);
        or <em>somehow</em> actually good looking backgrund (usually when they're planned. Plan your bgs guys, <em>do it</em>.) 
        good looking, actual backgruond. I don't have much to say about how I do them, except <em>good luck</em>.</p>

        <h1>Finishing touches</h1>
        <p>This includes: watermark; slight fixes; additional detail.
        Watermark is for obvious reasons: so other's wont steal it and claim it as theirs. Slight fixes can wary from fixing colours
        to whole proportions being moved around (it actually happened). The only aditional details I ever add is usually
        a line that goes around the whole figure to separate them from the background.</p>
        
        <p>Otherwise the background is my last stop.
        After this, it's best to wait for 30 or more minutes (even if I often don't do so) to help you spot any inconsistencies,
            mistakes, and anything that your "This image is burned into my memory and all I remember is pixels of light" brain didn't notice.
        Because of how much you usually stare at the image, it's easy not to notice the mistakes as the image might look 
        vastly different from what it actually is (<-happened to me).

        <h2>And that is all to my little "tutorial". It was, honestly, really fun to make, and I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. <br>
        If you took something away from this or found this helpfull, please do tell! It'd bring a smile to my face knowing
        it was useful to somebody ^^ <br>
        And now... good-BYE!!! </h2>
